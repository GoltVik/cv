  "about": "Iâ€™m a developer with over 6 years experience in mobile development. In my experience I co-created sharing apps ( car/bike/scooter ), and mobile apps for devices using E-Ink technology. Programming is not only my work but this is my passion. I like to learn new technologies and trying to create them by myself too. My main goal is to make applications simple and usable for user but in the same moment keep code clean and readable.",
